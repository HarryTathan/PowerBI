# PowerBI
Understanding Data Analysis with Power BI using illustrative visualizations along with Power Query and DAX

1. Understanding your data and what you want out of your dataset is the first step in data analysis.
2. Once you have clarity, then focus on cleaning of data, refining it by eliminaing or replacing null values by suitable values, selecting correct data types.
3. Entire cleaning of data can be done either in power query or using pandas if you are familiar with python.
4. EDA and Feature Engineering using Python could also be helpful in understanding your data well.
5. Ensure you have a clean dataset ready before you start analysing data.
6. Study the usage of different types of chart and select the best chart types based on what you need to represent.
7. Join the existing tables to create new realtionships (active or inactive) as per need and effectively use the primary and foriegn keys.
8. Familiarity with DAX would help you create new measures or tables as per the need and do calculations on your data for detailed analysis.
